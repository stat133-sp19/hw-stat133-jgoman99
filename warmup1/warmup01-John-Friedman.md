### Ingredients

-   6 Large Eggs
-   12 small ~~romaine lettuce leaves~~ Edit: *Romaine lettuce is again [safe to eat](https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2018/o157h7-11-18/index.html)*
-   2-3 teaspoons mayo
-   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-   1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
-   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
-   Salt & Freshly ground black pepper
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 anchovy fillet, minced
-   1 small clove garlic, minced
-   1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest
-   1/4 cups bread crumbs
-   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Tools

-   Saucepan
-   Skillet

### Steps

1.  Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with water
2.  Bring to a boil over high heat
3.  Once water begins to boil, reduce it to medium-low and simmer eggs for exactly 10 minutes
4.  Drain eggs and cover with cold water
5.  Arrange 12 small lettuce leaves on a serving platter
6.  Carefully peel the eggs and cut in half lengthwise
7.  Remove the yolks and place them in a small bowl. Arrange the whites on leaves
8.  Mash the yolks with the mayo, Dijon, Worcestershire (if using), lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the parsley until smooth
9.  Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper
10. In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat
11. Add the anchovy and garlic and cook, stirring, until the anchovy begins to dissolve into the oil, about 1 minute
12. Add the lemon zest and bread crumbs and saute them until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes
13. Stir in Parmesan and set crumbs aside
14. When you're ready to serve the eggs, spoon the yolk mixture back into the cavities of the egg whites, mounding it slightly in the center
15. prinkle each egg with some of the crumb mixture (about 1 teaspoon), allowing some to spill onto the lettuce cups
16. Garnish with remaining chopped parsley and serve

Euclidean Distance
==================

Definition
----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean Distance** between **p** & **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline {pq}).$

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$$
$$= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n(q\_i-p\_i)^2}$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** & **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or the **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$||\\textbf{p}|| = \\sqrt{(p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2)} = \\sqrt{p \\cdot p},$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
